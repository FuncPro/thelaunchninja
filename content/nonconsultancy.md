title: Startup Consultancy vs. Nonconsultancy
slug: nonconsultancy
date: 2016-07-21

When we first conceived the [mission to apply obsessive lean startup ideals](/mission)
to other people's start-ups, we naturally looked around to see how
other consultancies and businesses offer help to technology startups.

Even a [casual Google search for Startup Consultants](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=startup+consultants)
highlights a focus on marketing, support, forecasting, projections, etc.)

Hiring a consultant whose final output is a Powerpoint presentation
of recommendations seems like the least "lean" thing we can think of.

In fact, it's not hard to find [articles discouraging the use of consultants](http://www.businessinsider.com/startups-should-never-ever-rely-on-consultants-to-figure-out-what-their-customers-want-2010-5?IR=T)
altogether, particularly in the early days where you are still
forming your business model.

This is where the concept dawned on us: what we want to achieve
with *The Launch Ninja* is not advice on how to develop your startup
further; we want to be there to help you get the fire started and
to get your idea in front of customers precisely so you can validate
your business model.

It is clear that referring to this mission as *consultancy* would give
the wrong impression, so we needed a better word to describe it. We
decided to coin this as *Startup Nonconsultancy*.

This is mainly to make a
tongue-in-cheek point that we truly believe you really do not need
to spend time talking and getting advice: you need to learn from
customers. You need to show them something real to get that feedback.
You need to do it now.

Startup Nonconsultancy: less chat and more hack. Let us build over
a weekend what your competitors are still drawing on whiteboards.
