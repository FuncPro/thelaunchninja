At The Launch Ninja, we are passionate about the philosophy of "just
do it" and the value of getting *something* released and launched
rather than spend months planning.

This is the essence of [Eric Ries's highly-rated book, The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thelaunchninja-21&linkId=567d7c7a3c54295b4905ffa015403cdd):
successful startups focus on learning about their customers as soon
as possible via the build-measure-learn cycle.

The Lean Startup has gathered much momentum as a movement, but yet we
still see many startups still falling into traps even when they think
they are following this methodology:

* they create a simple page explaining the idea to gather sign-ups or
interested in a "beta" version, but that only proves people are
*saying* they are interested, not that they will pay for the real
product;
* they focus too much on [gathering validation through *asking*](https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it),
but what people will tell you about your idea again differs from what happens when
asked to pay for something; or
* they start with pre-selling offers or even making the product free
with the intent of charging later, but that only validates interest in
your product or service when it is free or sold at an unprofitable level.

True feedback on your idea is best measured when customers are
presented with a version of your product or service that showcases the
fullness of your idea, albeit in a way that is very minimal and
manual. This idea is advocated and described in great detail -- along with
the problems with the misguided approaches above -- in
[Dan Norris's excellent book, *The 7 Day Startup*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Day-Startup-Learn-Until-Launch/dp/1502472392/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thelaunchninja-21&linkId=6a45c132b9c0efefc5926a5c4dc04364).
His message is clear: you don't learn until you launch.

At the The Launch Ninja, we take this idea to obsessive levels and want
to be challenged to boil down any website idea into something that can
be built in only 2 days. The idea is simple: two days' consultancy
and engineering to take your idea from elevator pitch to working
MVP or prototype -- all for a tiny fraction of the cost of a team of
developers to spend months building an idea before it's tested on
real customers.

With years of experience in kickstarting new projects in the enterprise
and cloud computing platforms such as AWS, we believe we can take
even complicated application ideas, break them down to the smallest
MVP and deploy them to real infrastructure within two days.
